# Social Media Sales  Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project combines **sales data** with **social media sentiment analysis** to predict product performance. By analyzing the relationship between social media engagement, sentiment, and sales, the project aims to provide insights into how social media activity impacts product sales.

## Features
- **Sales Data Analysis**: Analyze sales trends and patterns over time.
- **Social Media Sentiment Scoring**: Use a lexicon-based approach to score the sentiment of social media posts.
- **Machine Learning Sales Prediction**: Train a Random Forest Regressor to predict sales based on social media sentiment and engagement.
- **Visualizations**: Generate visualizations to explore the relationship between sentiment, engagement, and sales.
